Welcome to Gathering Our Voices 2015, to be held in Prince George, British Columbia!

**We are honoured to hold Gathering Our Voices 2015 on the traditional territory of the Lheidli T'enneh First Nation.**

Your group, \*|GROUP|\*, is lead by \*|NAME|\* and registered under \*|EMAIL|\*. You can log in at any time at [https://gatheringourvoices.bcaafc.com](https://gatheringourvoices.bcaafc.com).

From the registration site you may proceed through registration at your own pace . If you close your browser or leave the site, your progress will remain attached to your account. The registration process has been simplified over previous years into a checklist style flow. Once you've completed a step, you can click the big red 'X' and check it off.

There are 6 steps:

* **Code of Conduct**: Review the Code of Conduct and ensure that your group members understand that they are not only representing themselves, but also their community and Aboriginal people as a whole.
* **Group Details**: A chance to review your groups details and reserve tickets for the Youth In Care feast.
* **Group Members**: Add members to the group that are going to be attending the conference.
  * You may partially complete members to serve as "Placeholders". All a member needs is a name (you can put 'Placeholder' if you want) and a delegate type, you may leave the rest blank until you have the necessary information.
  * This year, there is a cap on the number of Youth, Young Adults, and Young Chaperones that may attend the conference. Please try to ensure you have adequate placeholders.
  * There must be at least one Chaperone or Young Chaperone per 5 Youth. No restrictions are placed on Young Adults.
* **Useful Documents**: There are a number of opportunities to get more deeply involved with the conference, like participating in the Talent Show. You can find these documents here.
* **Payments**: Payment for your group. If the payment options detailed do not work for you, please contact us.
* **Workshops**: The workshop schedule will be released mid-February, once released, you may sign your members up for workshops.

**Once you have all 6 steps checked off, your group is ready to attend.**
