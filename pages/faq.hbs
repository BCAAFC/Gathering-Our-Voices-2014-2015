          <br>
          <div class="label label-success">YA</div> This denotes a Young Adult, 18-24 years old. These attendees require no supporting chaperones. Young Adults are generally eligible for most workshops.
          <br>
          <div class="label label-warning">YC</div> This denotes a Young Chaperone, 21-24 years old. These attendees are able to support up to 5 youth. Young Chaperones are generally eligible for most workshops.

        <h1>Workshops</h1>

        <h3>Which workshops conflict? When are they?</h3>
        <p>Gathering Our Voices operates using 4 different workshop 'blocks'. Attendees may select either one 3 hour session or two 1.5 hour sessions in each block. In the listing below, workshops in the same block with a different color icon conflict. For example, you couldn't sign up in sessions 1 and 3, since they would conflict.</p>

        <h3>What do the colors mean on the session listing?</h3>
        <p>The colors on the session listing are meant to give you a quick idea how full a given session is.</p>
        <p>Possible colors:
          <div class="label label-default">0</div> This (lack of) color means the workshop is full and cannot accept new members.<br>
          <div class="label label-danger">0</div> This color means the workshop is more than 3/4 full.<br>
          <div class="label label-warning">0</div> This color means the workshop is more than 1/2 full.<br>
          <div class="label label-success">0</div> This color means the workshop is less than 1/2 full.<br>
        </p>
