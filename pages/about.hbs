      </h2>
      <p>The BCAAFC has previously hosted twelve Aboriginal Youth Conferences. Youth delegates and chaperones from all over the country travel at their own expense to attend these conferences. The first two conferences hosted over 100 youth attendees, while the third saw attendance triple to over 460 youth delegates.</p>
      <p>The fourth and fifth conferences doubled attendance to over 800 youth. The 2008 Conference in Victoria had nearly 1000 people in attendance; the 2009 Conference in Kelowna had 1300 people attend; the 2010 Conference in Vancouver and the 2011 Conference in Prince Rupert, over 1500 people took part, in Nanaimo over 1600 people gathered together, and in Penticton more than 2000 people participated. Last year's conference in Vancouver drew an even larger audience. This overwhelming response serves to reinforce the need for a forum where Aboriginal youth can come together to begin to make positive changes in their own lives and in their communities.</p>
      <p>The purpose of these conferences is to unite youth from throughout the country in learning, healing and sharing and to provide tangible experiences of tools, resources and knowledge that the youth can bring back to their communities.</p>
