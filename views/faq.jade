          h4 Which workshops conflict? When are they?
          p Gathering Our Voices operates using 4 different workshop 'blocks'. Attendees may select either one 3 hour session or two 1.5 hour sessions in each block. In the listing below, workshops in the same block with a different color icon conflict. For example, you couldn't sign up in sessions 1 and 3, since they would conflict.

            .label.label-danger 0
            |  This color means the workshop is more than 3/4 full.
            br
            .label.label-warning 0
            |  This color means the workshop is more than 1/2 full.
