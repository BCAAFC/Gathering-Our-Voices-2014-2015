        h1 Privacy Policy
        h4 Data Transmission
        p This website uses secure SSL encryption to ensure that your data is not inspected "on the wire" by malicious attackers. Do note that, as with all encryption, this precaution does not ensure your data's safety against CSIS, the NSA, GCHQ, or other national spy agencies. Also note that the security precautions taken will be vulnerable to being stored and decrypted in the future when it is economical to do so.

        h4 Data Storage
        p Your personal information is stored by the following providers: Mongolab (Our database provider), Redis (Our memory cache provider). Both of these providers are widely used and adhere to security standards and practices. The BCAAFC also stores hourly backups of the databases in case of failure. Your data (except your password) is not stored encrypted as this would have a dramatic impact on performance, while not increasing security enough to warrant it.
        p Your password is stored using a 10-pass bcrypt algorithm in order to ensure that even in the event of a security breach your other accounts will remain secure.

        h4 Personal Information
        p Any information you submit as part of your registration will be accessible to the Gathering Our Voices conference coordinator and assistant coordinator(s). This information will be used for the express purposes of conference planning and organisation, and to ensure the safety of all delegates, volunteers, and staff. We do not distribute this data externally under any circumstances without your permission. Your provided email address and/or phone numbers may be used to contact you by the Gathering Our Voices conference team.

        h4 Third Parties
        p The BCAAFC conference team may disclose your name, age, gender, medical information, and emergency contact information to health professionals and cooking staff (in the case of food allergies) at the convention. This will be to ensure the readiness of the health and safety teams in the event of a medical emergency.

        h4 Internal Stat Tracking
        p We collect a minimal amount of data about you and your browsing through our website. This includes your coarse location, your IP, your web browser (and version), your operating system, as well as some information about the pages you visited and their performance. Note that this information is collected the same way most websites collect analytics, in our case, we use Google Analytics.

        h4 Digital Archives
        p At the end of the conference all delegate information is moved to a digital archive to help next yearâ€™s conference team anticipate the needs of future delegates. This allows the Gathering Our Voices conference coordinator to organize facilities, meals, workshops, and other resources with greater accuracy and efficacy.

        h4 BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres
        p The Gathering Our Voices conference team is hosted by the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres. Located in Victoria, British Columbia, the BCAAFC provides administrative, logistical, and technical support the GOV conference team. All BCAAFC employees are bound by a strict confidentiality policy regarding the protection and distribution of anonymous and personal data.

        p This policy may be amended in the future.
